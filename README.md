# DX CLI - Developer Experience CLI

DX CLI is a lightweight, extensible command-line interface designed to enhance the developer experience in software develpoment projects.
It provides a standardized way to create, share, and execute common development tasks across your team and projects.


## Features

- **Standardized Command Interface**: Consistent command structure across all your projects
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add custom commands specific to your project
- **Command Repository Support**: Install commands from external Git repositories
- **Global Command Access**: Run commands from anywhere in your project
- **Configuration File**: Automatically install commands from specified repositories
- **Self-updating**: Keep your DX CLI installation up to date


## Quick Installation

While in the root folder of your codebase, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dx-tooling/dxcli/refs/heads/main/dxify.sh | bash
```

Or download and run the script manually:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dx-tooling/dxcli/refs/heads/main/dxify.sh
chmod +x dxify.sh
./dxify.sh
```


## Usage

After installation, you can run commands using the `dx` command:

```bash
./dx <command>
```

To see available commands:

```bash
./dx
```


## Global Installation

To use the `dx` command from anywhere in your project, install it globally:

```bash
./dx .install-globally
```

This will install a wrapper script that allows you to run `dx` from any directory within your project.


## Creating Custom Commands

Create custom commands by adding shell scripts to the `.dxcli/subcommands` directory:

1. Copy the example script:
   ```bash
   cp .dxcli/subcommands/_example.sh .dxcli/subcommands/your-command.sh
   ```

2. Edit the script and update the metadata section:
   ```bash
   #@metadata-start
   #@name your-command
   #@description Description of what your command does
   #@metadata-end
   ```

3. Make your script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .dxcli/subcommands/your-command.sh
   ```


## Installing Commands from Repositories

Install commands from external Git repositories:

```bash
./dx .install-commands <git-repository-url>
```


## Configuration File

Create a `.dxclirc` file in your project root to automatically install commands from specified repositories:

```
[install-commands]
https://github.com/your-org/your-commands-repo.git
git@github.com:your-org/another-commands-repo.git
```

You can create this file in your codebase prior to the initial dxcli project installation, and it will automatically be honored when dxcli is set up. 

If this file exists in your project codebase and contains `[install-commands]` URLs, you can simply run `dx .install-commands` (without a URL) to install/update subcommands from these URLs.


## Updating DX CLI

Update your DX CLI installation to the latest version:

```bash
./dx .update
```


## Command Structure

DX CLI has two types of commands:

1. **Subcommands**: Regular commands for project tasks
2. **Metacommands**: System commands that manage DX CLI itself (prefixed with a dot)


## Best Practices

- Create commands for repetitive tasks in your development workflow
- Share common commands across your team via Git repositories
- Use descriptive names and helpful descriptions for your commands
- Keep commands focused on a single responsibility
- Document command usage in the script itself
